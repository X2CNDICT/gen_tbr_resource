Why are you here?

44
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,463
Hera's gone too far.

45
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,041
I'm here to join you if you'll have me.

[laughs]

47
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,331
She offered them your beloved sea.

48
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,170
Didn't she?

49
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,626
[chuckles] [Zeus] Yes.

50
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,380
Do you know where the cauldron is?

51
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,578
No.

52
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:15,083
But there is a caravan of maroon wagons
in their rear guard, heavily protected.

53
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,133
If I had to guess, I'd say it's there.

56
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,581
We must attack.

57
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,958
[Zeus] We will keep Hera's gaze
locked on us.

58
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,881
Blind her to everything else
that moves about the battlefield.

59
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,996
With Hera distracted, we can send someone
around their lines to find the cauldron.

60
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
[Zeus] We have to eliminate the giants.
It's our only hope.

61
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,460
I'll go.

62
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,918
I'll find it.

63
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,245
[Heron] You are the swiftest of the gods.

64
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,035
The one Hera would most expect.

65
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,330
I'll go.

66
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:11,996
You?

67
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,383
He's right.

68
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,825
She'd never expect something like this.

69
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,128
We can't risk the fate
of the war to a mortal.

70
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,328
[Zeus] He's not a mortal.

71
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,956
He's my son.

78
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,753
That'll come in handy.

79
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,536
[Apollo] Wait.

80
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,211
Hephaestus wanted you to have these.

Do you remember the demons
Alexia was chasing?

95

They were there to meet up with us.

96
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,956
We found the remains of a giant
and we sold it to them.

97

Well…

We'll make our stand here.

[Zeus] And rain down fire on them
until there is nothing left but ash.

103

No army has ever taken Olympus.

[Zeus] You think it gives you strength.

246

the choice must be…
