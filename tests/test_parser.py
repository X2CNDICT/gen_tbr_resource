  content = "Giants of the deep, hear me. I thought you'd see it my way.  Help me kill Zeus… and I'll make the sea yours again.    No.        Let me pass. Would you have preferred I left him there?  Why are you here? Hera's gone too far. I'm here to join you if you'll have me.  She offered them your beloved sea. Didn't she? Yes. Do you know where the cauldron is? No. But there is a caravan of maroon wagons in their rear guard, heavily protected. If I had to guess, I'd say it's there.   We must attack. We will keep Hera's gaze locked on us. Blind her to everything else that moves about the battlefield. With Hera distracted, we can send someone around their lines to find the cauldron. We have to eliminate the giants. It's our only hope. I'll go. I'll find it. You are the swiftest of the gods. The one Hera would most expect. I'll go. You? He's right. She'd never expect something like this. We can't risk the fate of the war to a mortal. He's not a mortal. He's my son.      Oh. That'll come in handy. Wait. Hephaestus wanted you to have these.  From one bastard to another.  They're here.          Do you remember the demons Alexia was chasing? They were there to meet up with us. We found the remains of a giant and we sold it to them. Well… if you still want redemption, today is your lucky day.  We'll make our stand here. And rain down fire on them until there is nothing left but ash. No army has ever taken Olympus. And no army will!  Fire!         It's time, Heron. This is how you show the world who you really are.    Bet that's the first time in your life you felt small.   He made it. Now! Shorten your range! Fire!     Heron, they've reached Olympus. Hurry.               It's not here. Heron, look! Do you hear that? Hear what? I think I know where the cauldron is.       They'll… they'll betray you. Don't let them destroy Olympus. You should have thought of that before you slept with that whore.     Argh!   Now. Quickly, Heron.   Go!   Hera. Stop this before it's too late. Hera, please. You did this to yourself!  No!  Hera!                You really must choose sides more wisely.           No. You should have joined me when you had the chance. Aaah!    Aargh!        There's no one left to stop me. Ah!                 It's time, Heron.  You won't be here forever.  Your anger is unyielding. You rely on it. You think it gives you strength. But you don't know what real strength is.     Look at what they've done to us. They ruined our lives. Our mother is dead because of them. Join me, brother. So you can rule.    Not all foes can be defeated by strength or anger. True power is found when one is calm. Turn inward. Enough! Heron! Let your anger go! Turn inward.    Hey, lovebirds. Well done.     Aah!  Not all demigods have divine strength but I believe you do. Let's find out.   I know your heart, brother. Run! Your rage, your fear. No! I felt it, too. No! For the sake of our mother I will ask you one last time. You are either with me or against me. If that is what the choice must be… I'm against you.              He was very proud of you. As we all are, brother.  That will be a good scar.     Huh.   You've used my bident well. Who are you? Hades.   It's far worse than you can imagine. But I can help you. Save you from the fate that awaits you there. I just need you to do one thing for me. Kneel."
